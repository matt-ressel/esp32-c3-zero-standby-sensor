 * main operational cycle by invoking the appropriate managers, and finally,

/**
 * @brief Main application entry point and orchestrator of the sensor's operational sequence.
 *
 * The sequence of operations in this function is critically optimized to achieve
 * two primary goals:
 * 1. To perform the temperature-sensitive BME280 measurement as early as possible
 *    after power-on, minimizing the impact of CPU self-heating.
 * 2. To hide the latency of physical processes (like capacitor charging for the
 *    battery measurement) behind other necessary, long-running initializations
 *    (like the Wi-Fi stack).
 *
 * @par Phase 1: Prerequisites and Critical Driver Initialization
 * Initializes NVS (a mandatory prerequisite for Wi-Fi) and the core hardware
 * drivers that need to be ready for immediate action.
 *
 * @par Phase 2: Optimized, Time-Sensitive Operations
 * This is the most time-critical section. It starts the physical battery
 * measurement process (which requires a ~25ms stabilization delay) and then
 * *immediately* performs the BME280 digital measurement. This ensures the
 * temperature reading is captured before the CPU has a chance to significantly heat up.
 *
 * @par Phase 3: Non-Critical Initializations
 * While the filter capacitor for the battery measurement is physically stabilizing,
 * the CPU is productively used to initialize the time-consuming network stack
 * (Wi-Fi and ESP-NOW). This effectively "hides" the 25ms battery delay,
 * reducing the total system "on-time".
 *
 * @par Phase 4: Main Logic Execution
 * Control is passed to the `sensor_manager`. It receives the pre-measured BME280
 * data and is responsible for the rest of the business logic: finalizing the
 * battery measurement, assembling the data payload, and transmitting it.
 *
 * @par Phase 5: System Shutdown
 * The final step is to signal the external timer via the `power_manager` to cut
 * system power. A fail-safe mechanism (deep sleep) is included in the unlikely
 * event that the shutdown signal fails.
 *
 * @note Note how `main.c` acts as a high-level "CEO", managing the *lifecycle*
 *       and *sequence*, while the `sensor_manager` acts as a "Manager", handling
 *       the *business logic* of processing and sending data. This separation of
 *       concerns is a key architectural feature of this project.
